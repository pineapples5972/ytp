Searches and plays Youtube stuff.

**If you get errors like:**

`jq: error (at <stdin>:1): Cannot iterate over null (null)`

Then it most likely means that the API key I use has hit its limits. You can make a new one here: https://console.developers.google.com/

Following [these](https://www.slickremix.com/docs/get-api-key-for-youtube/) instructions.

Then just replace it in line 10 of the script.
